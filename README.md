# What is DecentraNet?

DecentraNet is an open source project which aims to create decentralized and anonymous networks in python in as few lines of code as possible

# How does this project accomplish its goal?

Currently this project does not complete its goal of even creating a small scale network between devices

# How will it work?

Devices will assign their own ip addresses to themselves in a way which lets them talk to each other using minimal addresses
